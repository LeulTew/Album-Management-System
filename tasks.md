# Album Management System Improvement Plan

## Overview
Transform the existing C++ console-based Album Management System into a modern, robust, and feature-rich application that demonstrates advanced programming skills and best practices.

**Current Status**: Code modernized with std::string and std::vector, export features added, advanced search and statistics implemented. Exception handling implemented with custom exception classes. Modern C++ features used (lambdas, auto, range-based loops). Compilation errors fixed: updated function signatures, corrected lambda comparators for sorting, fixed member access. Project compiles successfully in CodeBlocks. Git repository initialized with comprehensive test suite and documentation. Architecture refactoring completed: Artist and Album structs converted to classes with encapsulation, manager classes created for separation of concerns. Cross-platform support added. Build system modernized with CMake. Documentation and licensing completed. Exit functionality fixed: statistics displayed before application termination from all exit points (main menu and submenus).

## Major Improvement Areas

### 1. Code Modernization
- **1.1** ✅ Replace all raw pointers with smart pointers (unique_ptr, shared_ptr)
- **1.2** ✅ Implement RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principles
- **1.3** ✅ Add comprehensive exception handling with custom exception classes
- **1.4** ✅ Use modern C++ features (auto, range-based loops, lambda functions)
- **1.5** ✅ Replace C-style strings and arrays with std::string and std::vector
- **1.6** ✅ Use std::filesystem for file operations instead of C-style file I/O

### 2. Architecture Refactoring
- **2.1** ✅ Convert structs to proper classes with encapsulation
- **2.2** ✅ Create separate classes: Artist, Album, ArtistManager, AlbumManager, FileHandler
- **2.3** ✅ Implement proper separation of concerns (MVC-like pattern)
- **2.4** Add an interface layer for data persistence
- **2.5** Implement the Command pattern for undo/redo functionality

### 3. Feature Enhancements
- **3.1** ✅ Add export functionality (CSV, JSON formats)
- **3.2** ✅ Implement advanced search with multiple criteria and filters
- **3.3** ✅ Add statistics and reporting features
- **3.5** Implement data backup and restore functionality
- **3.6** Add album cover image support (file paths and metadata)

### 4. User Interface Improvements
- **4.1** ✅ Create a cross-platform console interface (remove Windows-specific code)
- **4.2** ✅ Implement a modern menu system with better navigation
- **4.3** Add progress indicators for long operations
- **4.4** ✅ Improve input validation with real-time feedback
- **4.5** ✅ Add color-coded output and better formatting

### 5. Code Quality and Testing
- **5.1** Add comprehensive unit tests using Google Test framework
- **5.2** Implement integration tests for file operations
- **5.3** Add code documentation with Doxygen comments
- **5.4** Refactor long functions into smaller, focused methods
- **5.5** ✅ Add logging system for debugging and monitoring (Logger singleton class implemented with timestamped logging to file, added logging calls to load, add, and remove operations)

### 6. Build System and Deployment
- **6.1** ✅ Create CMakeLists.txt for cross-platform building
- **6.2** Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline
- **6.3** Create Docker container for easy deployment
- **6.4** Add configuration file support (JSON/YAML)
- **6.5** Implement version numbering and release management

### 7. Security and Performance
- **7.1** Add input sanitization to prevent buffer overflows
- **7.2** Implement thread-safe operations for concurrent access
- **7.3** Optimize file I/O operations with buffering
- **7.4** Add memory usage monitoring and leak detection
- **7.5** Implement data integrity checks (checksums)

### 8. Documentation and Packaging
- **8.1** ✅ Create comprehensive README with installation and usage guides
- **8.2** Add API documentation for classes and methods
- **8.3** Create user manual and developer guide
- **8.4** ✅ Add license file and contribution guidelines
- **8.5** Package the application for different platforms
- **8.6** ✅ Write Test Tasks.md Black Box table of what to test with entries written clearly(full app)


## Implementation Strategy
- Execute subtasks in order, starting with foundational changes
- Test each change thoroughly before proceeding
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Use version control for safe refactoring
- Document all changes and rationale

## Success Criteria
- Code compiles and runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS
- All original functionality preserved and enhanced
- Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
- Modern C++ standards compliance (C++17/20)
- Professional documentation and packaging
- Performance improvements over original implementation
